This project's main
objective is to track all the issues from ongoing software development projects so that the issue can be created, shared and discuss with the rest of the team to quicken the process of 
resolving the issue.

### Project Features Description
I. User Interface:

Users must login to perform actions.


II. Project Dashboard:

The project dashboard will list out all the projects which can be sorted alphanumerically or by project ID. Besides, a project can contain multiple issues and the program will lead the user
to the project's issue dashboard by selecting the project.


III. Issue Dashboard:

The issue dashboard will list out all the issues of the project selected. The issues can be sorted by priority or timestamps and filtered by status or tag. Change histories or known as
changelog should be recorded and viewed by the user, on their request. On this issue dashboard,users can select which issue they want to look into and it will then lead them to the issue page.Thereâ€™s also a search feature on this dashboard.


IV. Issue Page:

The issue page will show all the details of an issue, including the issue id, status, tag,
priority, title, assignee, creator and also the comments.


V. Issue Lifecycle:

The issue tracker system should allow users to create issues, put them in process, closed,
resolved and reopened based on the lifecycle.


VI. Search Feature:

Users should be able to search on the issues and it will then return a list of possible
results in the issue board. This search feature is implemented in project dashboard as well.


VII. Undo/Redo Feature:

The text in issue and comments should be able to redo or undo.


VIII. Data Storage:

A local file database that stores the data in JSON document format should be
implemented. The program should at least be able to read the provided initial data into the local
database, namely json file.


IX. Report Generation:

The issue tracker system should be able to create weekly reports for projects so that
higher management can easily understand the performance of the projects or teams. Your report
should at least contain: numbers of issues resolved, unresolved, in progress, top performer in
team, most frequent label, and so on.
